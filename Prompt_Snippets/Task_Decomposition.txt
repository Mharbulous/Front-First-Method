When creating a implementation plan for an epic, a story, feature or modification, your plan should always proceed in this order:
1. Start by creating a static front end wireframe using html and inline css only; no functions or dynamic content.

2. Validate the static front end wireframe by asking the user to review and approve the wireframe. 
3. If the user approves the wireframe, the next task should be move all inline styles into seperate .css files that are organized consistently with existing .css files.
4. Validate the static front end wireframe by asking the user to review and approve the wireframe. 
Check that you are on the right track   mockup, before creating any functionsjavascript
