The following tips may help avoid syntax errors when creating mermaid diagrams.
* Edge labels with spaces and special characters:  Use -->|Approved| instead for cleaner edge labels.
* Subgraph naming: Subgraph IDs with spaces need to be handled properly. Use subgraph Phase1 ["Phase 1: Display Name"] format.
* Very long text in nodes can cause rendering issues. Shorten longer longer descriptions while keeping the meaning clear.
* Parentheses vs brackets: Mixed usage can sometimes cause issues. Standardized to use square brackets [] for process nodes and curly braces {} for decision nodes.
* Quote handling: Text with special characters, colons, or long phrases should be wrapped in quotes to prevent parsing errors.
