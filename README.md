# FRONT FIRST METHOD

This front first method is a structured process for collaborative AI assisted coding.  The key tenant is to build the front end first and then use the front end as the primary source of truth for defining backend requirements.

The method consists of seven phases:
1. Planning (results in PRD)
2. Layout & Navigation (results in static Wireframe)
3. User Interface (results in static Mockup of interactive interface)
4. Engineering (Results in backend specification)
5. Prototype (results in a functional prototype)
6. Aesthetics and Design (results in an Alpha Test)
7. User Testing (results in a Beta test)
8. Production
