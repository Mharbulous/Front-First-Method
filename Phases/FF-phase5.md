# Phase 4.5: Technical Design

This phase focuses on creating comprehensive technical design documents and diagrams that explain the core logic and architecture of the application.

## Objectives:
- Develop detailed technical specifications for backend components.
- Create architectural diagrams (e.g., Mermaid diagrams) illustrating data flows, system interactions, and module structures.
- Define API contracts and data models based on the validated front-end.
- Ensure alignment between technical design and UI/UX specifications.

## Deliverables:
- Technical Design Document (TDD)
- System Architecture Diagrams
- API Specifications
- Database Schema (if applicable)
